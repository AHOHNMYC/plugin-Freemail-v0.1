# This file lists some of the intended additions for future versions of FreeMail
# 
# It also serves as a 'todo' list for me the author
# 
# * Mailing lists - 2 modes:
#     - secure:
#         - moderated
#         - mailing list account receives posts, and re-mails them to all
#           subscribers
#         - easy to drop miscreants from the list - just take them off the re-send list
#         - very slow and non-scalable
#     - insecure
#         - issue private key for mail identity to everyone
#         - all subscribers poll the same KSK queue
#         - very fast and 100% scalable
#         - difficult to kick people off the list
# 
# * Eventual compulsory ElGamal keys
#     - existing RSA keys not as secure as hoped (nop has informed me there's a one-step
#       fast cracking operation
#     - phase in compulsory ElGamal keys - much more secure
# 
# * fix problems in web interface seen with some windows installations and IE
# 
# * Test with very large files - ensure the FEC logic is working OK
