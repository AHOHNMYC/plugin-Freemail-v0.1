# Quick installation instructions for FreeMail.
# 
# --------------------------------------------
# ** If you have downloaded the generic version:
# 
# You'll need to build the python SSLCrypto extension module.
# 
# For this, you'll need the OpenSSL and Python development packages
# (headers plus libs) installed on your system.
# 
# To build the SSLCrypto extension, simply type 'make'.
# 
# If the make screws up, h[ave a look around your system and find out
# where the OpenSSL 'crypto' library is installed. For example, on
# Linux systems, it's usually in /usr/lib/libcrypto.so or
# /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so. Ditto for the OpenSSL include files,
# which usually live in /usr/include, or /usr/local/include.
# When you've determined these directories, edit the settings in the
# first couple of lines of the 'setup.py' file. When you get these
# settings right, the OpenSSL extension will build just fine.
# 
# Note that the file src/SSLCrypto.c is generated by the Pyrex Python/C
# wrapper generator, from the source file src/SSLCrypto.pyx. If you want
# to vet the source and build your own src/SSLCrypto.c, you'll need to
# install the Pyrex compiler, which you can get from the Pyrex website
# at: http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
# 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ** If you have downloaded the source version with windows binary module
# 
# you should see the file SSLCrypto.pyd
# in this directory, in which case FreeMail should run according
# to the instructions in the README file
# 
# 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# ** If you have downloaded the source version with Linux/BSD binary module
# 
# you should see the file SSLCrypto.so
# in this top-level directory, in which case FreeMail **MAY** work
# out of the box - refer to README.
# 
# If it crashes or locks up in strange places, (which will happen on some
# linux distros like Gentoo), you will instead need to download the generic
# version and build the binary module.
