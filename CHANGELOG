# Log of changes to FreeMail
# --------------------------
# 
# Build 020:
# 
#     * Tuned up peersite retrieval algorithm
#     * Incorporated updated pyFreenet module (v0.2.5)
# 
# 
# Build 019:
# 
#     * Fixed critical bug in POP3 server
# 
# 
# Build 018:
# 
#     * All mail identities now insert hourly, even though the DBR period is 
# still
#       24 hours - this aims to help keep identities more persistent
# 
# 
# Build 017:
# 
#     * Added missing __delitem__ method to cell class
#     * fixed cell.__delitem__ to handle integer or key args
# 
# 
# Build 016:
# 
#     * Hacked SMTP server to compensate for pine's weird command sequence
#       (sending RSET after the HELO)
# 
#     * Changed insert protocol to speed up mail transport, and make it more 
# reliable.
#       This involved:
#        - Changing DBR period for inserting identity records, from 3 days to 
# 1 day
#        - Changing the identity record fetch routine to more quickly get the 
# latest
#          available version of a peer's mailsite. This is done by launching 
# several
#          threads, each of which tries to retrieve the peer's mailsite n 
# periods back.
# 
#     * With this change, you (or your peers) can run FreeMail as seldom as 
# once each
#       two weeks, and mail will still get through (although running daily is 
# recommended).
#     * enabled multi-threading in FEC inserts in freenet.py
# 
#     * removed fatal FEC retrieval bug
# 
#     * removed 'Manage Peers' button on webui that was crashing things
# 
#     * added display of SSK public/private keys to identity display page
# 
# 
# Build 015:
# 
#     * Fixed windows exe installer (broken since build 011)
#       (stopped using McMillan Installer, switched to Py2EXE)
# 
#     * Added '-i' startup option to allow interactive console
# 
#     * Added a telnet server
# 
#     * Added more rigorous exception handling
# 
#     * Added more bounce messages in cases where message delivery fails
# 
# 
# Build 014:
# 
#     * Added handlers to fix missing 'retryBackoff' attribute in messages
#     * Added code to log cell attribute exceptions to file 
# 'freemail.log.crash'
# 
# 
# Build 013:
# 
#     * Fixed __iter__ attribute error (which was hitting python2.x users)
# 
#     * Modified setup.py script to build SSLCrypto, and to work whether
#       the Pyrex compiler is installed or not. This overcomes the build
#       problems which were affecting some users (particularly Mac OSX)
# 
# 
# Build 012:
# 
#     * Implemented exponential backoff/retry for re-sends of
#       unreceipted messages
# 
#     * Added code to attempt transparent recovery from
#       Freenet/Entropy node outages
# 
#     * Rebuilt the SSLCrypto binary (and C source/header) under
#       Python 2.2.1, which should eliminate problems for people with
#       2.2.1 and 2.2.2
# 
#     * Added code to check python version and complain if python is too old
# 
#     * Added automated database format upgrades, so hopefully you will never
#       need to wipe your database again. The update code will be maintained
#       to convert databases from all builds from 011 onwards.
# 
# 
# Build 011:
# 
#     * MANDATORY UPGRADE - INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER RELEASES
# 
#     * Ditch your old database and store directory please
# 
#     * Changed freemail address format from 'fred@blahblahPAgM'
#       to 'fred@blahblah.freemail'
# 
#     * Totally overhauled the in-freenet protocol:
#         * eliminated all RTS/CTS phase (too cumbersome)
#         * Replaced 'per-relationship' SSK queues with 'per-account'
#           KSK queues - protected against spamming/spoofing via
#           signature by sender and encryption to recipient. No way of
#           spoofing messages unless you can compromise an SSK key
#         * eliminated scheduled retries of past empty queue slots; now
#           relying fully on the send retry mechanism
# 
#     * Implemented optional POPmail receipts for all successfully
#       delivered messages (can turn off in config)
# 
#     * Implemented bounces to POP inboxes for messages that couldn't
#       be sent due to freenet exceptions (eg RouteNotFound errors)
# 
#     * message queues are polled via a 'sliding window' mechanism, which
#       should, together with the retry mechanism, prove sufficiently robust
# 
#     * provided an interactive FreeMail console - script 'console.py', which
#       launches a FreeMail server, and gives you a Python console for 
# inspecting
#       and manipulating the server objects
# 
# 
# Build 010:
# 
#     * Eliminated all use of Metakit, due to complications suffered by
#       users of some OSs in getting it built, importing it etc. This 
# eliminates
#       a whole class of problems
# 
#     * Added a generic data storage class called 'cell', which behaves kinda 
# like
#       a cross between a sequence and a dict, and also contains some of the 
# methods
#       of the old metakitplus module.
# 
#     * database is now saved as a python pickle
