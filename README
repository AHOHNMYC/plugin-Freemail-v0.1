Welcome to the maiden release of FreeMail!

---------------------
* What is 'FreeMail'?

Freemail is a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), or Mailserver, that supports you
in enjoying an unprecedented level of privacy and anonymity in sending
and receiving email messages.

It uses strong encryption and powerful anonymity features to make it nigh
impossible for an attacker to determine the contents of your email messages,
who you're sending to or when.

----------------------
* Freemail features

   * disguises your email addresses
   * avoids detection of who you're sending email to or receiving from
   * makes it almost impossible to detect even *if* or when you're sending or
     receiving messages
   * works 100% peer to peer
   * uses the Freenet network for high-grade privacy protection
   * totally compatible with your email client program, since it runs

----------------------------------
* How does FreeMail compare to PGP?

It's way more secure. No comparison.

With PGP, an attacker can still determine:
 * who you are sending email messages to and receiving messages from
 * when you are sending and receiving these messages
 * the subject lines of these messages

With FreeMail, all this information is hidden.

----------------------------------------
* How does FreeMail compare to Hushmail?

Arguably much better.

With Hushmail, it is possible for an attacker to detect that you're
sending or receiving Hushmail messages, and when. This alone can
give a lot of information in many cases.

Also, Hushmail is only as good as the operators of the Hushmail
service. Hushmail works with 'managed keys', which means that your
private encryption keys get stored as plaintext on the Hushmail
servers. It is not inconceivable that even now, attackers (eg 
government agencies) have gotten access to these keys. Which takes
away much of the very reason for using Hushmail in the first place.

With Freemail, your decryption keys are stored only your own hard disk.
You can even store them on an encrypted virtual disk (using PGPDisk or
BestCrypt etc).

Also, since Freemail uses Freenet as its transport, it becomes almost
impossible to determine even *if* you're sending or receiving messages.

--------------------------------------------
* What do I need to run FreeMail?

Requirements are:

 * A graphical web browser
 * A standard POP/SMTP-capable email client program, like Mozilla,
   Eudora, KMail, Evolution, Pine, Mutt or (if you must) Outlook (Express).
 * Freenet software installed and running (or, access to a Freenet FCP
   connection on another system). See www.freenetproject.org
 * Linux, BSD or an insecure, proprietary Microsoft operating system
 * If running Linux or BSD, you'll also need:
    * Python 2.2 or later installed
    * glibc 2.3 or later

-------------------------------------
* How do I run FreeMail?

If you're running on Linux or BSD, type:

  ./start-freemail.sh -h

to see the available options.

Once you've chosen your options, then launch the FreeMail program.

If you're running FreeMail on one box, but want to access it with an
email client or web browser on another host, then the first time you
run it, you'll have to specify the '--listen-hosts' argument. From then
on, the listen hosts will be saved in database so you won't have to
specify this again.

When you first run FreeMail, you'll see a message giving an address
to point your web browser, so you can complete the initial configuration
process.

------------------------------
* How do I configure FreeMail?

FreeMail has a web-based administrative interface.

By default, this interface can be reached by pointing your web browser
to port 8889.

For example, if you're running FreeMail on your local machine, then
point your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8889


--------------------------------
* Can I extend FreeMail?

Sure. If you're adept with Python, then look at the freemail.py
source file, and study the freemailServer class.

By deriving from this class, and providing some method overrides,
you can get FreeMail to do anything that turns you on.

If you're opening up the .leo file, please first set the tabs in your
preferences to -4. Otherwise, Leo will munge up the indentation and trash
your py files.
