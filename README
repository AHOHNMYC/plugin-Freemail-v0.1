This is the start of an email-over-Freenet 0.7 implementation. It's by no means
finished yet, and hence is only provided as source through subversion.

Currently only 'NIM Mode' is supported, 'NIM' coming from the concept of a
'nearly instant message' which was simply messages posted to KSKs, usually
used on freesites in older versions of Freenet. I'd also suggest 'Notably
Insecure Messaging'. It's not secure. At all. Anyone can read your mail.
You can use PGP or equivalent, but it's still easy to spam and hijack
addresses and whatnot.

Proper, secure implemenations of the Freemail protocol will come later.

All the data, including your passwd file, will most likley end up world
readable. Under unix, you could try running Freemail with a modified umask
if this bothers you, but I don't believe there is a portable way of doing
this in Java (or I haven't found it).

Finally, there *will* be backwards incompatable changes, so don't get
attatched to anything just yet.

Now you've read that (you have read that, right?):

compile: (however you compile Java, an ant buildfile is supplied)
run with --newaccount <account name> to create an account, eg:

java -cp build/ freemail.Freemail --newaccount fred

Use --passwd <account> <passwd> to set your password

java -cp build/ freemail.Freemail --passwd fred fredspassword

Run:

java -cp build/ Freemail.FNMail

Set up your email client to point at IMAP port 3143 and SMTP port 3025.

Your address is <accountname>@nim.Freemail

And yes, in case you were wondering, no - there's nothing to stop someone
else using the same address. I did say it was insecure ;)

Send me a message if you like, I promise to reply if it works :)

dbkr@nim.Freemail

(and since anyone can read Freemail messages right now, my Freemail public key
can be found at USK@vjETpEgDH-6EzlngZoO8KgOZm-B8AAlvZ-6oP6aQmow,DZYYfhpOxIrtdCNJiflIPjd0Qy8nA1d3Dwy86dcdhu0,AQABAAE/dbkr/10/contact/pubkey.fnmail.asc, or failing that, http://accidentalegg.co.uk/contact/pubkey.fnmail)

If it doesn't, dbkr@freenetproject.org!

Good luck!
